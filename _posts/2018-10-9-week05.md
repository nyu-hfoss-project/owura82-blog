title: Week 5 - Hacktoberfest Pull Requests

## **_Submitting A Pull Request_**

I was able to submit my first pull request for Hacktoberfest. Instead of looking thought the suggested repositories, I simply
searched "Hacktoberfest" on github and went through the repositories that came up. I saw that many people had created projects 
such as [this](https://github.com/ambujraj/hacktoberfest2018), [this](https://github.com/Showndarya/Hacktoberfest), 
and [this](https://github.com/Nguyen17/Hacktoberfest-Sign-In) that made it easier for beginners to make any kind of contribution. 

I made my [pull request](https://github.com/ambujraj/hacktoberfest2018/pull/1098) for the first project by simply adding a linker program I had written for my Operating Systems class. 

### **_Markdown_**

I also happened on a pretty easy, short and helpful markdown [tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) that I went through. I already knew some of the stuff but the
tutorial was easy to follow and I also learnt a few more tricks in the process _(like how to italicise text)_.
