# Github - Issues and Pull Requests

The task/objective for this week was to get more familiar with the Github UI and its other components such as pull requests and issue repports. 
This was done by reporting any identified issues on the blogs of other members and creating pull requests that attempted to fix the issues. I came to realize, although I think there might be a more efficient way, that you have to make a separate branch of the repository with the edits before you can make the pull request. 
Issue reporting turns out essentially to be making comments that can be addressed by examining the repository. 


# Project Selection

After an evaluation of the evaluations, I have narrowed the projects I am interested in to:

1. OpenMRS
Reasons: aligns with interests and involves a programming language I am comfortable with. 

2. Astropy (Open Astronomy)
Reasons: Seems like a good environment, less comfortable but still familiar with the language used, good level of activity

4. Open Street Maps

3. Systers 
Reasons: smaller group so might be open to more contributors.
