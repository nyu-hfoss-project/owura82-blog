**1. Astropy (Rename Columns Function)**

This [issue](https://github.com/astropy/astropy/issues/5159) has already has a PR (with multiple commmits added after) that attempts to fix this issue. It has not been accepted yet but I think it is a good opportunity to review the how the issue was 
solved. 
 
 

**2. OSM (Improve Search)**

This [issue](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/5214) involves improving the usability of the search bar in the 
UI. I think we could possibly tackle this if we either asked for a little more direction or spent more time with 
the project. 

**3. OSM**

This [issue](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/5212) is another one regarding usability that seems to be low 
priority for the main contributors. This means we could also spend a little more time with it if necessary.
