title: Week 3 - Issue Exploration 
---

# OpenMRS
Attempts at trying to access and explore the issues for OpenMrs proved to be a bit more tedious than anticipated. 
In addition with not working with the issue tracker provided by Github, their method of issue tracking seems a bit complex and
"not new-user friendly". 



# Astropy
Astropy seems to be condusive to potential contributors. It has a well labelled issue tracker and I noticed several issues,
although some of them were already resolved, that I think we could handle if we get a little more familiar with the project.



# Open Street Maps 
A brief review of a few of the many repositories of open street maps either resulted in issues that might be too complex to
handle or issues that have not been regarded for years.



### General Problem Noticed: 
Understanding the various open source projets, knowing what they do and figuring out 
how to download, install and get them working seems to be a significant hurdle in being able to make any kind of contributions. I guess we have to either find a
project that is relatively easier to grasp or be prepared to spend more time getting familiar with a project before we can make
any contributions.
