# Installing Projects 

## Open MRS

I was only able to attempt to install OpenMRS due to an embarassing amount of time spent trying to set the value of an environmental 
variable (JAVA_HOME). Although I was able to do this eventually, I could still not complete the installation process. The guide provided by both 
the Open MRS website and the Maven website were fairly unhelpful in the entire process.
