title: Week 4 - Project Installation 
---

## Open MRS

I was only able to attempt to install OpenMRS due to an embarassing amount of time spent trying to set the value of an environmental 
variable (JAVA_HOME). Although I was able to do this eventually, I could still not complete the installation process. The [guide](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core#build) provided by both 
the Open MRS website and the Maven website were fairly unhelpful in the entire process.


## Astropy
Started installation process for Astropy but was also unable to complete it. Ended at installation of prerequisites and [requirements](https://astropy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html) (Numpy and pytest).
