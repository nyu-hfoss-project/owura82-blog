### Issue 1
[Overlaping Panels](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/5212)

-The first thing I tried to do before approcahig the issue was to install the project by following the specified instructions.

-The installation process was moving smoothly for a while until a point when it just wasnt. Not entirely sure why but it just stopped installing and my command prompt was not returned. (Had to quit terminal).

-Despite installation failing, I acquainted myself with the actual OSM website a little and tried to attack the issue. 

-Due to lack of experience with CSS, HTML or Javascript, going through the files and trying to figure out where to look has been a bit of task..

-Still working on this now.
