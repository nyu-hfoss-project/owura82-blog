title: Week 5 - Hacktoberfest Pull Requests
---

## Pull Request Submitted 

For this week, I submitted a couple more pull request for. The first was for the NYU Bugs website where I just had to change
a file to match a specification that was listed in an issue. 
The second pull request was to the [spok repository](https://github.com/magnetis/spok/pull/69) where I added the calendar for Ghana. 

_* Also, just one more PR left for Hacktoberfest_

## Research on Project Issues 
I tried to look at issues for the projects that we selected (Astropy and Open Street Maps) but was still unable to make any 
progress with any of them. In a last ditch effort to be productive, I just looked at issues of other HFOSS projects and 
I found an [isssue](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform/issues/2373) in [Ushahidi](https://github.com/ushahidi/platform)
that I thought I could handle but had trouble locating the file.
